## Quick Start

```
docker run -p 80:80 -p <managedurl_port>:8080 -p 9000:9000 \
            -e PUBLIC_MANAGEDURL_HOST=<managedurl_host> \
            -e PUBLIC_MANAGEDURL_PORT=<managedurl_port> \
            -e REDIS_HOST=<redis_host> \
            -e REDIS_PORT=<redis_port> \
            -e REDIS_PASS=<redis_pass> \
            openwhisk/apigateway:latest
```

This command starts an API Gateway that subscribes to the Redis instance with the specified host and port. The `REDIS_PASS` variable is optional and is required only when redis needs authentication. 

On startup, the API Gateway looks for pre-existing resources in redis, whose keys are defined as `resources:<namespace>:<resource>`, and creates nginx conf files associated with those resources. Then, it listens for any resource key changes in redis and updates nginx conf files appropriately. These conf files are stored in the running docker container at `/etc/api-gateway/managed_confs/<namespace>/<resource>.conf`.

## Routes
See [here](doc/routes.md) for the management interface for creating tenants/APIs. For detailed API policy definitions, see [here](doc/policies.md).


## Developer Guide

### Running locally

 To build the docker image locally use:
 ```
  make docker
 ```

 To Run the Docker image
 ```
  make docker-run PUBLIC_MANAGEDURL_HOST=<mangedurl_host> PUBLIC_MANAGEDURL_PORT=<managedurl_port> \
    REDIS_HOST=<redis_host> REDIS_PORT=<redis_port> REDIS_PASS=<redis_pass>
 ```
 
 The main API Gateway process is exposed to port `80`. To test that the Gateway works see its `health-check`:
 ```
  $ curl http://<docker_host_ip>/health-check
    API-Platform is running!
 ```
 
### Testing

 Unit tests can be found in the `api-gateway-config/tests/spec` directory.

 First install the necessary dependencies:
 ```
  make test-build
 ```
 Then, run the unit tests:
 ```
  make test-run
 ```
 This will output the results of the tests as well as generate a code coverage report.
